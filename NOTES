Currently having issues attempting to build ngpsice library. Some
functions, like cvprod, don't seem to be incorporated into the
shared library for some reason.

The following command works (note, you may need to nuke the src
directory)

../configure --with-ngshared --enable-xspice --enable-cider --enable-openmp --enable-osdi --enable-klu --prefix=/usr CFLAGS="-g -m64 -O0 -Wall" LDFLAGS="-m64 -g"

In addition, the clean way of including a shared library with an executable is to use


	g++ -I ${HOME}/.local/include -L ./lib -Wl,-rpath '$$ORIGIN/lib' test_spice.cpp -lngspice -o cppspice

Where the key thing is `-Wl,-rpath '$$ORIGIN/lib'`. That `$ORIGIN` is a special variable that is resolved
upon execution of the executable by the loader. It will resolve to the executable's path.

Unable to get pyspice to work. It says both version 42 (what we built) is unsupported and 36 (which 
ubuntu provides). Not 100% positive it failed with version 36, but 42 throws an exception.
