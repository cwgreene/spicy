Currently having issues attempting to build ngpsice library. Some
functions, like cvprod, don't seem to be incorporated into the
shared library for some reason.

The following command works (note, you may need to nuke the src
directory)

../configure --with-ngshared --enable-xspice --enable-cider --enable-openmp --enable-osdi --enable-klu --prefix=/usr CFLAGS="-g -m64 -O0 -Wall" LDFLAGS="-m64 -g"

In addition, the clean way of including a shared library with an executable is to use


	g++ -I ${HOME}/.local/include -L ./lib -Wl,-rpath '$$ORIGIN/lib' test_spice.cpp -lngspice -o cppspice

Where the key thing is `-Wl,-rpath '$$ORIGIN/lib'`. That `$ORIGIN` is a special variable that is resolved
upon execution of the executable by the loader. It will resolve to the executable's path.

Unable to get pyspice to work. It says both version 42 (what we built) is unsupported and 36 (which 
ubuntu provides). Not 100% positive it failed with version 36, but 42 throws an exception.

UPDATE: nope, it did work with 36, it just didn't print out the log messages since they were all
debug. switched to `print` to validate.

Okay, so why version 42 doesn't work is currently an open question.

UPDATE 2: Actually, it looks like it worked mostly with version 42, just not the last command
issued to it.

Okay, so muddling around with params, I'm able to get it to simulate 1 second at 10*-5 resolution in less
than 1 second (.688 seconds). That's potentially good enough for real time audio simulation. Next get the
cpp version working so we don't have to deal with python overhead. That might bring us into the MHz range.

Obvious follow up questions are "What if the circuit is more complicated than a simple voltage divider?"
